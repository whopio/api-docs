## Initial onboarding

Starting the onboarding process, you will be prompted to name your company and connect your Twitter account (optional). Your company name should match the product you are selling - here is an example.

Company Name: Grammarly<br/>
Twitter: Grammarly

Next, you are asked to select the type of digital product you are selling. You can always change the option you choose at a later stage. Here are the options we have:

- Discord Server
- SaaS / Web App
- Templates
- Desktop Software
- Files

The final step in the initial onboarding process is to choose both a company logo and a business slogan. Your slogan is a 30 character snippet of text that represents what you are selling and will be showcased on the [Whop marketplace](/listed).

For a more comprehensive breakdown of our features, skip ahead to the features section of our documentation.

To create your first product, navigate to the ‘**Products**’ tab or simply select ‘**Setup Product**’. On the product page, you will be able to customize:
