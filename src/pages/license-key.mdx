# License Key Integration

When users purchase access to products on Whop, they are given a license key. In your software, you can require your users to enter a license key in order to use your software.

## Setting up on the Whop dashboard

After you have created your company, create a product and add a license key to the product via your dashboard.

## Integrating with your product

After you've added the license key capability to your product, Whop's API makes it incredibly easy to validate a user's license key.

<CodeGroup
  title="Validate a License Key"
  tag="POST"
  label="memberships/:id/validate_license"
>
  ```js
    import axios from 'axios';

    const checkAccess = async (accessPassId, accessToken) => {
        try {
            const response = await axios.get(`https://api.whop.com/api/v2/memberships/${id}/validate_license`, {
                headers: {
                    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
                },
            });
            return response.data;
        } catch (error) {
            throw error;
        }
    };

    export default checkAccess;
    ```
