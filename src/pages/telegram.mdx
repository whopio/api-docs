Whop enables companies to sell direct access to their Telegram channels. Manage members, simplify the purchase & joining process, remove freeloaders, and more.

## Creating a Telegram product

To start selling access to your Telegram channel, create a new product and connect your Telegram by selecting ‘Telegram’ in the ‘What’s included?’ pop-up.

You will be required to add the ‘Whop Bot’ as an admin to the desired Telegram channel you want your purchasers to access - the Whop bot can be searched and added as shown below. 

Once the Whop bot is in your Telegram channel, you will need to generate a code that verifies that you are indeed the owner of the Whop company. Once generated, paste this into your Telegram channel.

You are now ready to start selling!  Add a pricing option and follow the onboarding steps. You can find our guide on creating a product page [here](/creating-company).

## Telegram FAQ

**Can I sell access to multiple Telegram channels at the same time?**

Yes, you can sell access to multiple channels. You can even make it, so a single membership gives a purchaser access to more than one channel.

**One of my customers wants to change the Telegram attached to their membership. What should I do?**

There is no set way for customers to change the Telegram they have linked to their membership. They must create an entirely new Telegram account and rejoin the Channel through their hub.

**What should I do if I have any issues or my customers need help?**

We are available 24/7 to help you and your customers. Please go directly to our customer support [here](https://dash.whop.com/intercom).
