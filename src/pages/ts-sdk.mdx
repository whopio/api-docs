# Whop TypeScript SDK

The Whop TypeScript SDK allows developers to access the Whop API quickly and easily.

## Getting Started

<Note>
  You'll want to make sure that you're signed up for a [Whop seller
  account](https://dash.whop.com/) and have properly setup your account before
  proceeding.
</Note>
<Note>
  If you are a new to programming or just interested in creating your app using
  NextJS and Vercel, we highly recommend you create your web application using
  our [pre-built template](https://github.com/whopio/next-template). This
  documentation will focus on creating your web application without a built-in
  platform like Vercel and framework like Next (while still utilizing the Whop
  API).
</Note>

### Installing Required Packages

Make sure that you're on the latest version of Node.js, as well as TypeScript.

```sh
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

## Using Whop's SDK

To begin using Whop's SDK, install the package below.

```sh
npm install @whop-sdk/core --save-dev
```

Once installed, make sure to retrieve your Whop OAuth credentials (Client ID and Client Secret), and API Key from your [Whop Developer Settings](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). You will also need to have created a Product on the Dashboard ([which you can learn how to do here](/creating-company#creating-your-first-product))

### Setting up `.env` file

You'll want to create an `.env` file in your project's root directory - you can store all of your sensitive environment variables related to Whop here.

```ts
// Found on 'https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer'
// under 'API Keys' and 'OAuth2 Setup'

WHOP_CLIENT_ID = 'XYVZVMzCEN.......'
WHOP_CLIENT_SECRET = 'DO7js19JRp.......'
WHOP_API_KEY = 'pfijRtaYTN.......'
```

### Initalizing the SDK

To initalize the Whop SDK, you'll want to pass your company's API token that you just got above. This will give you access to progamatically retrieve products, plans, and users.

```ts
import { WhopSDK } from '@whop-sdk/core'

// Initializing the WhopApi SDK with the 'sdk' variable
const sdk = new WhopSDK({
  // Import your WHOP_API_KEY from your .env file
  TOKEN: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
})

// Recommended to export the function
// so that it can be quickly and easily used elsewhere
export default sdk
```
