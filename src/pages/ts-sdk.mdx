# Whop TypeScript SDK

The Whop TypeScript SDK allows developers to access the Whop API quickly and easily.

## Getting Started

<Note>
  You'll want to make sure that you're signed up for a [Whop seller
  account](https://dash.whop.com/) and have properly setup your account before
  proceeding.
</Note>
<Note>
  If you are a new to programming or just interested in creating your app using
  NextJS and Vercel, we highly recommend you create your web application using
  our [pre-built template](https://github.com/whopio/next-template). This
  documentation will focus on creating your web application without a built-in
  platform like Vercel and framework like Next (while still utilizing the Whop
  API).
</Note>
