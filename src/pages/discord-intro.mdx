Selling access to Discord roles and Discord servers has never been easier using Whop. Manage members, automatically add members to your server, automatically give roles, remove freeloaders, and so much more. 

## Creating a Discord perk

To start selling access to a Discord role, create a new product and add a Discord perk to it by selecting ‘**Discord roles**’ in the what’s included pop-up. 

Once you have connected your Discord server and moved the Whop bot above the role you want to provide access to, go to ‘**Discord roles**’ again and select the ‘**+**’ button next to the role you want to provide.

Once added, add a pricing option to your product.
