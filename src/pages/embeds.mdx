# Embeds

Embed a product page into your website

![Embed Demo](https://i.imgur.com/LqrPMUw.gif){{ className: 'rounded-lg w-full' }}

Embeds are unique way to show off your Whop product page, without the consumer having to leave your site. Embeds are useful as they can streamline conversions and minimize the friction associated with getting a consumer to purchase.

## Creating an embed

To add an embed, add the snippet of code below to your website. The snippet is added so that when a customer clicks an element, the embed pops up. An example of the code snippet can be seen below. You can update the link in the “href” below, and the text of the button in the example below to match your companies info.

```jsx
<a href="https://whop.com/pascio/">ButtonText</a>
<script src="https//whop-snippet-universal.pages.dev/snippetScript.js"></script> 
```
