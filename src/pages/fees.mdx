# Fees

Whop has different fees depending on if Whop acts as the Merchant of Record (MoR) for your business or if you choose to use Stripe for your payments. If you have not heard of MoR you can skip this part, as MoR is only beneficial for countries that have VAT taxes (EU & UK). All fees are automatically deducted from your final credit.

<br/>
Letâ€™s break down our fees:

1. When Whop is the Merchant of Record (MoR) on card payments, Whop charges a flat fee of 4.5% + 40 cents. 
2. If you choose to integrate your own payments processor such as Stripe, Whop simply charges 3% flat.
3. For both Coinbase commerce, and Ethereum crypto payments on Whop we take a 1% flat fee. 
4. For any sales generated on the [Whop](http://Whop.com) marketplace, we will take a 30% fee for those transactions. For any marketplace sales we act as an affiliate and only take this fee if we generate the sale for your company (if the person checks out via https://whop.com/marketplace/your-company-name).

<br/>
Simplified breakdown:

| Type | Fee |
|:--------:|:--------:|
| Stripe Integration | 3% + Stripe fees |
| Whop Payments (MoR) | 4.5% + 40 cents | 
| Crypto payments | 1% |
| [Whop](https://whop.com) Marketplace Sales | 30% |
