# Fees

When using Whop, the only fees you incur are payment processing fees. Whop is a free-to-use platform and takes no extra fees on-top of what’s required to operate your business.

For the main form of payment on Whop - Card payments, there are two different fee structures available. The fees are broken down by whether or not Whop acts as the Merchant of Record (MoR) for your business or not. If you have not heard of MoR you can skip this part, as MoR is only beneficial for countries that have VAT taxes (EU & UK).

<br/>
Let’s break down our fees:

1. For card payments we only charge 1.5%. You will only have to pay payment processing fees which are Stripes fees directly. You can take a deeper dive into Stripe’s fees [here](https://stripe.com/pricing). To reiterate, Whop is 100% free to sign up and only charges a 1.5% transaction fee.
2. For Merchant of Record (MoR) card payments we charge a flat fee of 4.5% + 40 cents. 
3. For crypto payments on Whop we take a flat 1% fee across the board. Whether you take direct ETH payments or use Coinbase commerce we will only take a 1% fee. 
4. For any sales generated on the [Whop](http://Whop.com) marketplace, we will take a 30% fee for those transactions. For any marketplace sales we act as an affiliate and only take this fee if we generate the sale for your company.

Simplified breakdown:
