# Webhooks

## Integrate via webhooks

Webhooks are a way for an application to provide real-time notifications to other systems when certain events occur. They allow you to build integrations that respond to specific events in a more efficient and scalable way than constantly polling an API for updates.

To integrate with webhooks, you will need to set up an endpoint on your own server that will receive the webhook notifications. You will then configure your webhooks to send notifications to this endpoint, and implement handling for the webhook notifications on your server.

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up and implement an integration with webhooks, including how to set up a webhook endpoint, configure your webhooks, and handle webhook notifications. We will also provide examples of how this can be done in JavaScript

If you aren't familiar, [webhooks](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/guides/what-are-webhooks-how-they-work#what-is-a-webhook) are a widely popular form of communication between web servers. Instead of having to constantly refetch data from an API, your server will be sent updates (aka webhooks) whenever an event happens on the providers end.

## What kind of webhooks do we send?

We send webhooks when key events happen for your company and users. These events are useful for knowing when a User has purchased your product and when they should be granted access to your software. We also send an event when the User should no longer have access.

Thus, your application is simply responsible for accepting incoming requests from Whop and processing them as you see fit.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="membership.went_valid">
        - This webhook will fire when a membership becomes valid, typically when a membership is created or a user checks out.
        - Business Logic Example: Mark a User's subscription as valid, which allows them to access a gated section of my app.
        - Important Attributes: `id`, `valid`, `status`, `user.id`, `access_pass.id`
      </Property>
      <Property name="membership.went_invalid">
        - This webhook will fire when a membership becomes invalid, typically when a subscription is canceled or the membership expires.
        - Business Logic Example: Mark a User's subscription as invalid, which blocks them from accessing a gated section of my app.
        - Important Attributes: `id`, `valid`, `status`, `user.id`, `access_pass.id`
      </Property>
      <Property name="payment.succeeded">
        - This webhook will fire when a payment is successful, for both new and existing memberships.
        - Business Logic Example: Update a User's credit balance with the amount of the payment and send them a receipt via email.
        - Important Attributes: `id`, `membership`, `status`, `final_amount`, `user.id`, `access_pass.id`
      </Property>
      <Property name="payment.failed">
        - This webhook will fire whenever a payment attempt fails. This is usually due to a card having insufficient funds, or a crypto payment not having a proper allowance or balance.
        - Business Logic Example: Record the failed payment attempt so that you can remind the user with an overlay inside of your app to have them update their payment method.
        - Important Attributes: `id`, `membership`, `status`, `final_amount`, `user.id`, `access_pass.id`

## Configure your webhook URL

The Whop Business dashboard has a dedicated [developer settings page](https://dash.whop.com/developer), where you'll be able to access, update, and manage all things related to Whop API. This is where you'll begin configuring your webhook endpoint URL.

![Webhook Demo](https://i.imgur.com/zTRCHNC.gif){{ className: 'rounded-lg w-full' }}

## Test your Endpoint

Enter your correct route into the modal and click the **Send test webhook** button. Our server will attempt to `POST` an example webhook event to the endpoint your provided. If your application accepts the request and returns a 200 HTTP response code, you'll see a green message saying "Test successful". Now, your endpoint will begin receiving events.

Here is an abbreviated example of the payload that would have been sent to your server:

```json {{ 'title': 'Example payload' }}
{
  "action": "membership.went_valid",
  "data": {
    "id": "mem_DWWmfqMNSk5TVF",
    "created_at": "2022-12-05 02:28:57 +0200",
    "access_pass": {
        ...
    },
    "user": {
        ...
    },
    "plan": {
        ...
    },
    "status": "active",
    "license_key": "DEMO-508ED6-8D5E4B16-2A409FW",
    "metadata": {},
    "valid": true,
    "quantity": 1,
    "renewal_period_start": "2022-12-05 02:28:57 +0200",
    "renewal_period_end": "2023-01-04 02:28:57 +0200",
    "wallet_address": null,
    "custom_fields_responses": {},
    "discord": null,
    "email": "email603180@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

## Handling events

Here is an example of how you could handle this webhook notification.

<CodeGroup title="Webhook Event">
    ```js
    function handleMembershipWebhook(payload) {
        // Extract the relevant information from the payload
        const membershipId = payload.data.id;
        const status = payload.data.status;
        const user = payload.data.user;
        const plan = payload.data.plan;
        const valid = payload.data.valid;

        // Do something with the extracted information, such as updating a database or sending an email
        updateMembershipInDatabase(membershipId, status, user, plan, valid);
    }
    ```
    ```python
    def handle_membership_webhook(payload)
        # Extract the relevant information from the payload
        membership_id = payload['data']['id']
        status = payload['data']['status']
        user = payload['data']['user']
        plan = payload['data']['plan']
        valid = payload['data']['valid']

        # Do something with the extracted information, such as updating a database or sending an email
        update_membership_in_database(membership_id, status, user, plan, valid)
    end
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Once you start receiving events, the next step is to make use of them so that you can deliver access of your product to the User who just purchased. Here is an example database you can build:

- Make a `Users` table
    - Store the `user.id` and the `user.email` from the event payload
- Make a `Subscriptions` table
    - Store the `Membership` `id` from the event payload
    - Store the `valid` boolean from the event payload
    - Attach it to the user you just made
