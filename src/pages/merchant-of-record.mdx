Whop is a merchant of record (MoR). A merchant of record is a term used to describe the legal entity selling goods or services to an end customer. When a customer makes a purchase, all handling of payments and responsibility for all things relating to that purchase, falls on the Merchant of Record. This means that the collecting of sales tax, processing of refunds, honoring chargebacks, complying with local consumer law, and ensuring PCI compliance is all handled by Whop.
